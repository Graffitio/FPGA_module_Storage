Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin fnd/ring1/temp_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell cpu/ir/register_temp[3]_i_2__0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cpu/alu_acc/U_acc/acc_high/h_cc/register_temp_reg[0]/CLR, cpu/alu_acc/U_acc/acc_high/h_cc/register_temp_reg[1]/CLR, cpu/alu_acc/U_acc/acc_high/h_cc/register_temp_reg[2]/CLR, cpu/alu_acc/U_acc/acc_high/h_cc/register_temp_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
